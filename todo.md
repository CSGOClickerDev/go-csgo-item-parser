# To Do:

- [x] ~~Instead of hardcoding weapon names, pull them from language file instead~~
  - [x] ~~To work out which skin names begin with `â˜…``, items have this
    `"prefab"		"melee_unusual"`, or something similar for gloves (check this)~~
- [x] ~~Determine which skins can be Souvenir and StatTrak~~
  - ~~`weapon_case_souvenirpkg`~~
- [x] Build language object with lookup function built in
- [ ] Improve error handling (especially with crawlToType function)
- [ ] Get Skin rarity from `items_game.txt` under the `paint_kits_rarity` sections
- [ ] Get Knives/Gloves for each crate
  - So far the only link from a crate to knives is `gamma2_knives2_unusual`
